## Lab 5

### Create athletes table

First, we created the table.

![Create athletes table command](./assets/create_athletes_command.png)

Then we added data to the table.

![Insert athletes command](./assets/create_athletes_command2.png)

This is the resulting table.

![Athletes table command](./assets/create_athletes_table.png)

We added those sql commands to the create athletes migration file as well as the schema.

### Create migration table

Then, we added a table to track the migrations.

![Creata migration command](./assets/create_migration_command.png)

This is the resulting table.

![Creata migration table](./assets/create_migration_table.png)

We mirrored those changes in the schema.

### Update athletes table

Afterwards, we updated the athlete table.

![Update athlete command](./assets/update_athletes_command.png)

This is the resulting table.

![Update athlete table](./assets/update_athletes_table.png)

Once again, those changes were mirrored in the schema.

### Schema testing

Finally, we tested our schema to make sure it reflects all the migrations.

![Schema command](./assets/schema_command.png)

This is the resulting athletes table. It is up to date.
